## Description
Connect Four, as we know it today, was released in 1974 by Milton Bradley and created by Howard Wexler, though humans have been playing alignment games for thousands of years. In Connect Four, the goal is to line up four of your own tokens (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) before your opponent. Tokens are dropped from the top of the board, coming to rest at the lowest empty spot in the column. 

## Play Instructions
Player 1 begins the game. Drop your tokens into the board by clicking your desired column above the play area. When hovering above the board, a token of your color will show your selected column. On mobile, tap the triangles above the board to drop your token. Get four in a row to defeat your opponent. The background can be changed
